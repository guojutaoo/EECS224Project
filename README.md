# Parallel-RSA-Algorithm

A parallel RSA algorithm with multithreading in python, implemented both sequential and parallel RSA algorithm and time comparision between
them, also used Fast Modular Exponentiation and Extended Euclidean algorithm for calculating the inverses to make the program much faster.
