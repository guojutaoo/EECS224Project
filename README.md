# Parallel-RSA-Algorithm

A parallel RSA algorithm with multithreading in python, implemented both sequential and parallel RSA algorithm and relative time comparision, also used Fast Modular Exponentiation and Extended Euclidean algorithm for calculating the inverses to make the program much faster.
