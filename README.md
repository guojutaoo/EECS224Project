# Parallel-RSA-Algorithm

A parallel RSA algorithm with multithreading in python, implemented both sequential and parallel RSA algorithm and time comparision between
them, also implemented Fast Modular Exponentiation and Extended Euclidean algorithm to calculate the inverses to make the program much faster.
